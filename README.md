# odwp-devhelper

Plugin that helps with development for [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/).

__Note__: This plugin uses excelent [PrismJs](http://prismjs.com) library for syntax highlighting. Thanks!

## Description

Plugin offers set of wizards for creating new plugins, themes or significant parts of code (such as admin tables or metaboxes). These wizards produces source codes that are downloadable within `ZIP` archives. Values entered into wizards and generated codes are stored for later so can be easily reused or updated.

Plugin is not just for administrators but can be used by any registered user of your [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) site.

## TODO

- [x] screen options cannot be saved on page __New table__.
- [x] available templates in screen option __Used template__ should be extendable via [`apply_filters`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/apply_filters/) so each wizard could easily set up own templates.
- [ ] finish __New table__ wizard.
- [ ] finish __New plugin__ wizard.
- [ ] finish __New theme__ wizard.
- [ ] finish __Custom post type__ wizard.
- [ ] update version to __0.1.0__.
- [ ] make this plugin extendable by using [`apply_filters`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/apply_filters/) and [`do_action`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/do_action/).
- [ ] forms have to be _AJAXish_ if possible (i.e. if browser supports JavaScript) - generated code snippets should be updated on fly (after any input is changed).
- [ ] add Czech translation
